# PEEK ~ (Paul, Ethan, Elizabeth, Kora)
#### This is the main repository of our Software Engineering project as part of CS-UY 4513 section C.


#### HEROKU:  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/peek-nyu/deploy/heroku-git
#### TRAVIS:  https://app.travis-ci.com/github/Ephil012/PEEK

Note that for TRAVIS they are having issues with organizations on the free plan being able to create builds according to their support. We forked the repo and ran it on a personal account for the build since that does not have issues according to their support. They should have organizational access fixed soon though.

## Organization Founders:
#### Kora Hughes
#### Elizabeth Akindeko
#### Ethan Philpott
#### Shaoxuan Liu
