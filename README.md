## Project Idea:
* A website that aids users in scheduling events. Website uses existing calendar data and suggests the best time for an event.
* Story: User wants to schedule a study time. User imports an .ics file into software, types in some quick event information if wanted, and presses a button. The software then outputs an .ics file with the new event, which the user imports into their calendar software of choice.
  * user can also login to access their previously stored calendar information
* Advanced Features:
  * Automation of .ics import/export via google calendar login credentials
  * Software has suggested time-slots and learns the user's habits based on software use
  * Software categorizes events by type (study time, break time, etc.)
  * User can customize software's suggestions by event type
  * Extra Data: user profile images, complex event data (particpants), recurring events

## Requirements:
**Database** 
(note: for simplicity, all ints are positive where 0 represents an uninitialized value.)

User Table
* _user_id (string) //unique database key
* username (string)  
* password (string)

Event Table
* _event_id (string) // unique database key
* eventname (string)  // imported information via <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/ics"> .ics </a> specific <a href="https://icalendar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"> structures </a>
* start_time (datetime)
* end_time (datetime)
* location (string)
* description (string)

Connection Table  // used to refrence which events are owned (viewable/editable) by which users
* _event_id (string) // unique database key
* _user_id (string) // unique database key

**Create**
* Users can create an account with a username and password
* Users can create an event - also updates via .ics file import
  * eventname (required)
  * start_time (required)
  * end_time (required)
  * location (optional)
  * description (optional)

**Read**
* Users can get their user info
  * User Name
  * Password
* Users can get a list of all events and its subsequent event information
  * Event Name
  * Start Time
  * End Time
  * Location
  * Description
* Users can search for events by a keyword.

**Update**
* Users can change their user info
  * User Name
  * Password
* Users can edit the information for a specific event
  * Event Name
  * Start Time
  * End Time
  * Location
  * Description

**Delete**
* Users can delete their account (along with account information)
* Users can delete an event.

## Design:

**Create**
1. '/users/create/<username>' Users can create an account by passing a username and password (both required). Users will have all of the above data sent, stored in the database. Returns a success message + the associated _user_id (autogenerated) if it works. Else returns an error message if failed (including one if username already exists)
2. '/events/import/<calendar>' Logged-in users can import events from their personal calendar via .ics file upload. All event information available is imported into the database. Returns a success message and a list of the imported event _event_id's if it works. Else returns an error message if failed
3. '/events/create/<event>' Logged-in users can create new events by filling out a form of event info: event name (required), start time (required), end time (required), location (optional), description (optional). Returns a success message and the associated _event_id if it works. Else returns an error message if failed

**Read**
1. '/users/get/<_user_id>' Logged-in users can get their user information. The API will return a dict with username and password
3. '/events/get/<_user_id>' Logged-in users can get all scheduled events under their account. The API will return a list of dicts with the eventname, start_time, end_time, location, description (aka event information). Else returns an error message if there are no events and returns an error message if failed.
4. '/events/get/<eventname>' Logged-in users can get a specific event by passing in a keyword. The API will return a list of dicts (with event information) such that all returned events' eventnames contain the keyword. Else returns an error message if there are no events and returns an error message if failed.
3. '/times/get/<_user_id>' Logged-in users can get a list of suggested event times. Users pass in a date_range (start, end date - required) and duration(required). The API will return a list of start_time (required) and end_time (required) pairs (tuples). These times can later be used with create_event to create an event at the chosen suggested time. Else returns an error message if failed

**Update**
1. `/events/update/<event_id>` Fulfills requirement 1 and 2 of Update.  Users can change an event's properties. The event is specified with event_id (required). User can specify an eventname, location, start_time, end_time, description, owner, or attendees for the events. Else returns an error message if failed
2. `/user/password/update/<username>` Fulfills requirement 3 of Update. Users can change their password. Users pass in their existing_password (required) and new_password (required) and a username (required). Returns a message if successfully changed. Returns a success message + username if it works. Else returns an error message if failed
3. `/user/google/update/<username>` Fulfills requirement 4 of Update. Users can add or update their linked Google Calendar account. Users pass in the google_key (required) and a username (required). Returns a message if successfully changed. Returns a success message + username if it works. Else returns an error message if failed
4. `/breaks/update/<break_id>` Fulfills requirement 5 of Update. Users can update their break times. The break is specified with break_id (required). User can specify an breakname, start_time, end_time, or owner. Else returns an error message if failed

**Delete**
1. `/events/delete/<event_id>` Fulfills requirement 1 of Delete. Users can delete a given event using an event_id. Users pass in an event_id (required). Returns a success message with the event_id if it works. Else returns an error message if failed (with event_id).
2. `/breaks/delete/<break_id>` Fulfills requirement 2 of Delete. Users can delete a given break using an break_id. Users pass in a break_id (required). Returns a success message with the break_id if it works. Else returns an error message if failed (with break_id)
3. `/users/delete/<username>` Fulfills requirement 3 of Delete. Users can delete a given user using a user ID. Users pass in a username (required). Returns a success message with the username if it works. Else returns an error message if failed (includes username)

**Important: all items passed into REST not in the URL are in the body of the request**
