# PEEK ~ (Paul, Ethan, Elizabeth, Kora)
#### This is the main repository of our Software Engineering project as part of CS-UY 4513 section C.
![](https://app.travis-ci.com/PEEK-NYU/PEEK.svg?branch=main)

#### HEROKU:  https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps/peek-nyu/deploy/heroku-git
#### TRAVIS:  https://app.travis-ci.com/github/PEEK-NYU/PEEK

Note that for TRAVIS they are having issues with organizations on the free plan being able to create builds according to their support. We forked the repo and ran it on a personal account for the build since that does not have issues according to their support. They should have organizational access fixed soon though. The link to the one being used for Travis is here https://github.com/Ephil012/PEEK/tree/main We plan to switch to using this repo once Travis fixes the issue.
